# Mazerunner

## Description
A Bash script where the goal is to navigate your way out of a maze.
There are two maps, start with "small-maze" to get familiar with the commands.
When you feel brave enough, give "maze-of-doom" a try and make sure to bring a torch!

## Quick Start
* Start Server: node ./server/index.js
* Start Mazerunner: ./client/mazerunner.bash loop
